"""1)Immediate Actions:
Implement transaction thresholds and real-time alerts based on model insights.
Start a pilot phase to test the fraud detection system in a controlled environment.
2)Short-Term Actions (1-3 months):
Integrate fraud detection with existing transaction systems.
Train staff on new procedures and provide initial customer education.
3)Medium-Term Actions (3-6 months):

onitor and evaluate the system's performance, making adjustments as necessary.
Begin regular retraining of the model with new data.
4)Long-Term Actions (6-12 months):

Scale the fraud detection system to handle increased transaction volumes.
Continue to refine and enhance the system based on ongoing feedback and performance data."""
